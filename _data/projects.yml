- title: Visual Causality Analyst
  teasor: "img/vca_teaser.png"
  abstract: A general and comprehensive visual analytic system for learning causal graph models embedded in multi-dimensional datasets. Taking advantage of both automated algorithms and interactive approaches, the system gets domain users involved in the loop of causal reasoning and is applicable to data in a wide scope of domains. The system is also novel in that it can handle both numeric and categorical variables within one unified model and return plausible results.
