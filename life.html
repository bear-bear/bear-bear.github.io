        <h1>Some about my person life...</h1>
        <p>I am currently living at Long Island of New York happily with my fiancee Qian (the young woman in the left photo). Thanks to her, I am now a fan of traveling and we have been to quite a few places around North America since we met at Stony Brook. It is still mysterious to me that why we never knew each other back in China but have to fly to the other side of the Earth to get together.</p>

        <p>I spend most of my childhood and teenager in a small town called Qufu located in the Shandong province in eastern China. The town does not have any special production but is famous for being the hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius</a> and the residence of his descendence family for the past two thousand years. There are a lot of places of interest, make sure you visit there if you are going to China :)</p>
